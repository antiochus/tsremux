TS/Bluray/MPEG transport stream remuxer/muxer/demuxer

This is a mirror of the TsRemux source code which was licensed GPL3 by a coder named "dmz".

It has modifications by "spacecat56" and "hobBIT".

I (Jens MÃ¼hlenhoff) intend to provide a more visible mirror on github, since there is no single original download location and no SCM location at all.

The source code was taken from the installer executable "TsRemux0.23.2.exe" which can be downloaded on a few download sites around the web.

The original download was hosted on "megaupload.com" which is now (2012) defunct.

I hope this code is useful to someone, but as alternative you may look into ffmpeg/mencoder today.
